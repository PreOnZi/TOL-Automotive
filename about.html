            This project was inspired by the presence of seldom appearing
            advertisements in the Waze navigation. Coincidentally, it was always
            trying to lore me into the local Aldi store. A company I have spent
            with (so far) over 5 years.
            <br />
            Building on this experience and the fact that modern cars - even the
            chaper ones - are nowadays loaded with smart sensors and have large
            screens, the idea of exploring advertising implementation into car
            infotainment systems came to existence. Funnily enough, when
            starting the research months later, I was surprised to see aricles
            written - more than in my initial research. The I learnt that Ford
            recently filled for a patent in february 2024 (published in August
            2024) that would utilise the cars' screens and speakers to play
            adverts based on their location and other privacy-defying
            information. The reaction online has been overwhelmingly negative
            and I can see why that would be. In this version of the future, only
            the advertisers and Ford benefit from this implementation.

          <ul>
            <li>But what if the customers could benefit from this</li>
            evolution as well?
            <li>What if they could select the level of advertising?</li>
            <li>
              What if the amount of advertising they have to view could directly
              lower their monthly car payment?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <br />To explore whether the reaction woulds till be so negative
            after giving the consumer more control and incentives, I developed
            this experience. Building on Yablonski's ideology of Cognitive Load
            and Kara's(2015) research into the accessibility of academic
            literature, I find this site as a complimentary but vital part of my
            work. With Jakob's UX law in mind, I took inspiration from other car
            manufacturers' websites and developed an experience of configuring a
            new vehicle. Keeping the flow of the process as close to reality as
            possible was vital to truly understand the consumers' view on the
            matter. In this case it meant that after customizing the car's
            powertrain, interior colour etc, the next option before financing is
            selection from three different levels of advertising involvment.
            From the least intrusive to the msot intrusive. depending on the
            level, the final price/monthly payment of the car decreases.

            Methology: performing the researched topic - allowing the user to
            experience it can be overwhelming to only deal with text experiences
            (cognitive load) -the information we have exceeds the space we have
            making the experience closer to reality John Yablonski Flow - if you
            enjoy something, you're more likely to have positive connotation to
            it
