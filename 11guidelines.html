          Advertising is a significant part of the TOL business model, as it
          enables lower prices for same (or more) equipment, quality and premium
          experience. This guide is for brands interested in joining the growing
          number of companies developing the 'Personalised driving experience'.
          For thorough understanding of the customer side, it is recommended
          that the

            TOL vehicles are equipped with a plethora of systems and sensors
            which can provide helpful information & additional touch-points
            available for branding.
            <br />
            This enables brands to stay on the mains of their consumers all the
            time or give them the needed push when they may need it, such as
            offering discount at a nearby cafe, when signs of fatigue are
            detected.

        <p>
          Roads with frequent accidents and dangerous overtaking can trigger a

          additional layer of awareness. It can also provide safety information
          live on top of the navigation system.

          Available for all offers, including local promotions. This type of
          messaging is perfect for brands that mostly operate online and want to
          provide special offers to TOL drivers, who get to save their
          promotions and then take advantage of it once they have exited the
          car. All offers can take advantage of the data and electronic trails,
          depending on the level of integration chosen by the customer and the
          integration type.

          product from your offer.

          Services are only available on 'Deeper integration' levels, especially
          in the 'Network' sphere. Services are developed based on extensive
          data collected about individual users and aim to tailor their
          experience with their TOL vehicle as close as possible, with the help
          of their favourite brands. Brands, therefore, can associate themselves
          with positive experiences and simplification of the customers' lives.

          <li>If the car spends prolonged time within the radius, the interrupted remote offer is automatically saved to the user's account and will be sent as a notification to their application.</li></ul></li>
          <li>Visual advertising remains on the screen for the agreed duration even if the audio portion has been skipped</li>
