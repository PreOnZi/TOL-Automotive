          What is the correct way of implementing advertising into car
          infotainment systems in the UK context?
        </h5>

            TOL is a fictional automotive company and its website exists to
            demonstrate how advertising could become a part of the configuration
            process as well as teh car's infotainment system.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Now the secret is out of the way;
            <br />
            This project was inspired by the presence of seldom appearing
            advertisements in the Waze navigation. Coincidentally, it was always
            trying to lore me into the local Aldi store. A company I have spent
            with (so far) over 5 years.
            <br />
            Building on this experience and the fact that modern cars - even the
            chaper ones - are nowadays loaded with smart sensors and have large
            screens, the idea of exploring advertising implementation into car
            infotainment systems came to existence. Funnily enough, when
            starting the research months later, I was surprised to see recently
            written articles. I learnt that Ford recently filled for a patent
            (in February 2024, published in August 2024) that would utilise the
            cars' screens and speakers to play adverts based on their location
            and other privacy-defying information sourced from their customers.
            The reaction online has been overwhelmingly negative and I can see
            why that would be. In this version of the future, only the
            advertisers and Ford benefit.
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              But what if the customers could benefit from this evolution as
              well?
            </li>

            <li>What if they could select the level of advertising?</li>
            <li>
              What if the amount of advertising they have to view could directly
              lower their car payment?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <br />To explore whether the reaction would still be so negative
            after giving the consumer more control and incentives, I developed
            this experience. Building on Yablonski's ideology of Cognitive Load
            and Kara's(2015) research into the accessibility of academic
            literature, I find this site as a complimentary but vital part of my
            work. With Jakob's UX law in mind, I took inspiration from other car
            manufacturers' websites and developed an experience of configuring a
            new vehicle. Keeping the flow of the process as close to reality as
            possible was vital to truly understand the consumers' view on the
            matter. In this case it meant that after customizing the car's
            powertrain, interior colour etc, the next option before financing is
            selection from three different levels of advertising. From no
            involvement to the most involved. Depending on the level, the final
            price/monthly payment of the car decreases. The initial discount,
            however, is not the sole benefit and as you can see after going
            through the process other benefits are listed.
            <br />
            <br />
            Through discussions, secondary research and growing understanding of
            the many components involved, I came to a conclusion that there
            might be a *correct* way of advertising into cars' systems. If done
            correctly and for the benefit of all involved parties, it may prove
            to be a viable path forward.
