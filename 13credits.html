            I want to thank my supervisor, Shani-Louise Osei, for her guidance
            and continuous support. I also want to thank Dr Joe Jackson PhD FHEA
            for sharing his knowledge and generosity with his time. Lastly,
            thanks to Nikola Šťastná for tirelessly working with me on developing this site and adding parts that were beyond my capabilities.
