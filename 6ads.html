              <b>Level One Advertising</b>
              <br />
              Level One offers a moderate level of advertising implementation
              into the car's system. This includes the infotainment screen and
              the car's audio system. The displayed advertisements will never be
              in the driver's way of operating the vehicle safely. Additionally,
              as the level One offers low personalisation, only selected data
              will be shared with TOL and advertisers. This will result in less
              relevant advertising being shown. TOL will collect and share
              driving habits and most common routes; GPS information.
              <br />
              <br />

              <b>Level Two Advertising</b>
              <br />
              Level Two offers more advertising within the system compared to
              Level One. It again uses both the infotainment system screen and
              the vehicle's audio system. Additionally, a small portion of the
              driver's gauge cluster is reserved for advertising purposes. As
              Level Two operates with higher personalisation, in addition to GPS
              data, TOL will utilise the vehicle's microphones to gauge topics
              of interest from the cabin. This function can be temporarily
              disabled in the car's settings, however it will turn on
              automatically after five minutes and on start. None of the
              advertising features will prevent the driver from safe operation
              of the vehicle.
