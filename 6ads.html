        <h1>Infotainment Advertising</h1>
        <br />
        <h3>Terms & Conditions</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Level One Advertising</b>
          <br />
          Level One offers a moderate level of advertising implementation into
          the car's system. This includes the infotainment screen and the car's
          audio system. The displayed advertisements will never be in the
          driver's way of operating the vehicle safely. Additionally, as the
          level One offers no personalisation, no data will be shared with TOL
          for the purpose of advertising. This will result in less relevant
          advertising being shown.
          <br />
          <br />

          <b>Level Two Advertising</b>
          <br />
          Level Two offers more advertising within the system compared to Level
          One. It again uses both the infotainment system screen and the
          vehicle's audio system. As Level Two operates with higher
          personalisation, the vehicle will collect & send relevant data,
          including snippets from the vehicle's internal microphones. This
          function can be temporarily disabled in the car's settings, however it
          will turn on automatically after five minutes and on start. None of
          the advertising features will prevent the driver from safe operation
          of the vehicle.

          <br />
          <br />

          <b>General</b>
          <br />
          By selecting one of the options above the customer agrees to keeping
          and using the vehicle for at least four (4) years with minimum 5000
          miles driven annually. The customer has the option to op-out of either
          selected advertising levels within the first two months of purchase by
          paying the difference to RRP.
          <br />
          The infotainment system runs on Google's Android Automotive platform
          and can therefore be connected to apps such as Spotify and YouTube.
          Android Auto and Apple Car Play is not available for vehicles with
          advertising integration enabled.
          <br />
          Audio system volume will automatically rise to 10 (out of 50) when an
          advertisement starts and the 'Mute' option is disabled for the first 5
          seconds, until skipping the promotion becomes available.
          <br>
          <br>
          Advertising will trigger even if there is no media playing or the car's cabin is
          quiet. It will, however postpone and queue advertisements during phone
          calls. Level Two has the ability to analyse conversations and will not
          disturb an important/serious conversation. Level One does not
          have this feature.
          <br />
          <br>
          Please feel free to reach out to any dealership or the customer
          service for more information.

            <p>
              The trickiest mode, but we are keeping you safe! We know car
              infotainments are often criticised for moving controls to touch
              screens. Understandably, introducing distracting advertisements
              into the mix would be irresponsible. To mitigate this, the
              advertising in our systems never seeks more attention that other
              tasks on the screen. Visual advertisements have a set place within
              the home screen and never overlay other apps during driving. You
              can interact with them only to the degree any other control would
              require them, never requiring more than one or two taps. There
              aren't paragraphs of text to read, because alongside visual
              advertising – and as a part of it – is the audio advertising.
              Since the media is playing through the car’s system, the
              advertisement will not start mid-song or a phone call and will
              scan for a suitable gap in a podcast before starting, making sure
              you are not left on a clift hanger. If the advertisement is
              geographically sensitive it will give the option to reroute to the
              address of the business, while all offers can be saved, using
              buttons on the steering wheel.
              <br />
              <br /><b>All advertising is ‘skippable’ after a few seconds.</b>
              <br /><b> No advertising will start during a parking sequence.</b>

              When parked, the core functionality of the advertising is
              identical to the driving mode, however if the parking brake is
              engaged, more information can be displayed on the screen. You can
              view more text and the offer can launch over most of the screen.
              However, all offers remain mostly audio with static visual ques -
              there si no video advertising. On top of that, no offer is worth
              getting in danger and you can always skip the ad or change into
              Driving mode.

              You won't miss any offers! Even when the vehicle is parked, and
              the driver is not in it, you can take advantage of the
              TOL-exclusive promotions.Through our TOL companion app (available
              on <b>Android</b> and <b>iOS</b>) not only you can control the car
              remotely, but most interaction with our offers happens here, too!
              Whenever you receive an advertising message, and save it, this
              message is then stored in your account and is sent in the form of
              a push notification to your phone once you have locked the
              vehicle. This notification includes the promotion from the
              advertisement but also allows you to visit the website or take
              different actions depending on the message – while it is safe, and
              you are not driving anymore. You can also check your history and
              enable Out-Of-Car Offers - you get the discounts even when you are
              nto driving.
              <br />
              Another exciting option in the app is route planning. Your car
              will understand you in no time. And when you are going for a road
              trip, why not let the BLINK take you to your comfort places?
              <br />
              Like to explore new flavours and quisines, your BLINK will find a
              charger and a nearby restaurant, thats OUT THERE.
              <br />
              Prefer to stick to the known? No problem, your vehicle will
              charge, while you can eat your favourite meal!
