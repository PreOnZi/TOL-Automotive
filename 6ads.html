        <h3>Terms & Conditions</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Level One Advertising</b>
          <br />
          Level One offers a moderate level of advertising implementation into
          the car's system. This includes the infotainment screen and the car's
          audio system. The displayed advertisements will never be in the
          driver's way of operating the vehicle safely. Additionally, as the
          level One offers low personalisation, only selected data will be
          shared with TOL and advertisers. This will result in less relevant
          advertising being shown. TOL will collect and share driving habits and
          most common routes; GPS information.
          <br />
          <br />

          <b>Level Two Advertising</b>
          <br />
          Level Two offers more advertising within the system compared to Level
          One. It again uses both the infotainment system screen and the
          vehicle's audio system. Additionally, a small portion of the driver's
          gauge cluster is reserved for advertising purposes. As Level Two
          operates with higher personalisation, in addition to GPS data, TOL
          will utilise the vehicle's microphones to gauge topics of interest
          from the cabin. This function can be temporarily disabled in the car's
          settings, however it will turn on automatically after five minutes and
          on start. None of the advertising features will prevent the driver
          from safe operation of the vehicle.

          <br />
          <br />

          <b>General</b>
          <br />
          By selecting one of the options above the customer agrees to keeping
          and using the vehicle for at least four (4) years with minimum 5000
          miles driven annually. The customer has the option to op-out of either
          selected advertising levels within the first two months of purchase by
          paying the difference to RRP.
          <br />
          The infotianment system runs on Google's Android Automotive platform
          and can therefore be connected to apps such as Spotify and YouTube.
          Android Auto and Apple Car Play is not available for vehicles with
          advertising integration enabled.
          <br />

          <h3>The long print</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The trickiest mode advertising must deal with. Car infotainments are
            already often criticised for moving most – if not all – of their
            controls to the touch screen, forcing the drive to take their eyes
            off the road (Kessels, 2024). Understandably, introducing
            distracting advertisements into the mix would likely cause public
            and legislative outrage. To mitigate this, the advertising in the
            proposed systems never seeks more attention that other tasks on the
            screen. Visual advertisements have a set place within the home
            screen and never overlay other apps during driving. The driver can
            interact with them only to the degree any other control would
            require them, never requiring more than one or two taps of the
            screen with minimal text. Alongside visual advertising – and as a
            part of it – is the audio advertising. Since the media is playing
            through the car’s system, the advertisement will not start mid-song
            or a phone call and will scan for a suitable gap in a podcast before
            starting. If the advertisement is geographically sensitive it will
            give the option to reroute to the address of the business or be
            saved, using buttons on the steering wheel. All advertising is
            ‘skippable’ after a certain time. No advertising will start during a
            parking sequence.

            The core functionality of the advertising is identical to the
            driving mode, however if the parking brake is engaged, more
            information can be displayed on the screen. Still, all content is
            strictly audio and visual separately, the system does not support
            videos.

            Often forgotten, however it is the most common state of the vehicle
            pointed out by Kessel (2024). The vehicle is parked, and the driver
            is not in it. This may seem like the car’s infotainment has no
            reach, yet that is not the case. As important as the in-car system
            nowadays is the accompanying mobile application. Through the
            application many functions can be accessed and many of them make
            more sense on the phone more than within the car. The phone
            application is where most interaction with the advertising can
            happen. Whenever the driver receives an advertising message, they
            have the option to save the message. This message is then stored in
            their account and is sent in the form of a push notification to
            their phone once they have locked the vehicle. This notification
            includes the promotion from the advertisement but also allows them
            to visit the website or take different actions depending on the
            message – while it is safe, and they are not driving anymore.
